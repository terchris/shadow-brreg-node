# My impout 1:
I have a postgres database named importdata on port 5433. username and password is "postgres". write me a typescript program that lists the first 10 records in the table brreg_enheter_alle. define a separate file named config where you put the code for connecting to the database.
Make the code that query the database a function named getFirstRecords. the getFirstRecords must be called with await and return a array of the returned records. Name the file index.ts

# ChatGPT response 1:
config.ts

import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 5433,
    user: 'postgres',
    password: 'postgres',
    database: 'importdata'
});

export default pool;

index.ts

import pool from './config';

async function getFirstRecords(): Promise<any[]> {
    try {
        const res = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM brreg_enheter_alle LIMIT 10');
        return res.rows;
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        throw err;
    }
}

async function main() {
    const result = await getFirstRecords();
    console.log(result);
}
main();
You can call the main function and it will return the first 10 rows of the table brreg_enheter_alle.


# My impout 2:
change config.ts so that variables are set in the .env file and create the .env file

# ChatGPT response 1:
config.ts

import { Pool } from 'pg';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

const pool = new Pool({
    host: process.env.DATABASE_HOST,
    port: parseInt(process.env.DATABASE_PORT),
    user: process.env.DATABASE_USER,
    password: process.env.DATABASE_PASSWORD,
    database: process.env.DATABASE_NAME
});

export default pool;


.env

DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5433
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres
DATABASE_NAME=importdata

You will need to install dotenv package using npm or yarn.
In the .env file, you should set the variables for your specific environment.
You should make sure that the .env file is not checked into source control for security reasons.
The program will now read the variables from the .env file, allowing you to easily change the configuration without modifying the code.


npm install dotenv
or
yarn add dotenv

  },
  "dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",

# ChatGPT response 3:

You can add the following scripts to your package.json file:
{
  "name": "shadow-brreg-node",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": "https://github.com/terchris/shadow-brreg-node.git",

  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "develop": "tsc -w"
  }
}
The "build" script runs the TypeScript compiler (tsc) once and compiles your code to JavaScript.
The "develop" script runs the TypeScript compiler (tsc) in "watch" mode, which will continuously watch for changes to your TypeScript files and automatically recompile the code to JavaScript.

After adding the scripts you can run npm run build to build the project, and npm run develop to start development.


# My impout 4:

}
The "build" script runs the TypeScript compiler (tsc) once and compiles your code to JavaScript.
The "develop" script runs the TypeScript compiler (tsc) in "watch" mode, which will continuously watch for changes to your TypeScript files and automatically recompile the code to JavaScript.

After adding the scripts you can run yarn build to build the project, and yarn develop to start development.

# My impout 5:

I get an error message when doing yarn build. What do I do to fix it? This is the message: src/config.ts:1:22 - error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'pg'. '/Users/tec/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Projects/learn/urbalurba2023/shadow-brreg-node/node_modules/pg/lib/index.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
  Try `npm i --save-dev @types/pg` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module 'pg';`

1 import { Pool } from 'pg';

# ChatGPT response 5:

This error message is telling you that the TypeScript compiler cannot find a declaration file for the 'pg' module. In order to fix this, you need to install the @types/pg package, which contains the declarations for the 'pg' module.

You can install this package by running the following command in your terminal:


yarn add -D @types/pg
This will install the types for the pg library into your devDependencies.

Alternatively, you can also add the following line at the top of your config.ts file


import * as pg from 'pg';
This would allow you to use the pg library in your code without any errors and you don't need to install types for it.

# My impout 6:

I used the yarn add -D @types/pg and the problem was fixed. But there is one more error: src/config.ts:8:20 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
  Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.

8     port: parseInt(process.env.DATABASE_PORT), 

# ChatGPT response 6:

This error is occurring because the 'DATABASE_PORT' variable from the .env file might be 'undefined' when the application starts. The parseInt function expects a string as an input, but it's getting 'undefined' instead.

There are a few ways you can fix this. One way is to check if the 'DATABASE_PORT' variable is defined before passing it to the parseInt function.


port: process.env.DATABASE_PORT ? parseInt(process.env.DATABASE_PORT) : 5433,
This will check if the 'DATABASE_PORT' is defined or not. If it's defined it will parse it to integer otherwise it will use the default port number 5433

Another way is to set the default value of the 'DATABASE_PORT' in .env file to 5433.

DATABASE_PORT=5433
With this setup, the parseInt function will always have a valid string as an input and the error will be resolved.

# My impout 7:

I checked. The .env file has the variable DATABASE_PORT=5433 . What can be wrong?

# ChatGPT response 7:

It is likely that the issue is with how you are loading the environment variables.

You can use the dotenv package to load the variables from the .env file.

In the config.ts file you have to import the dotenv package and use the config() method to load the variables from the .env file.


import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();
This needs to be done before you are using the variables from the .env file like process.env.DATABASE_PORT

Make sure that you have the .env file at the root level of your project and that it is being loaded correctly by the dotenv package.

Also check if the typescript is configured to include the .env file when transpiling the code. You can check the tsconfig.json file for that.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

# My impout 8:

In config.ts I changed import dotenv from 'dotenv'; to import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'; But that did not resolve the problem. What part of the tsconfig.json must be changed in order for .env variables to be read?


# ChatGPT response 8:

You are correct that the import statement should be import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'

Regarding the tsconfig.json file, by default, TypeScript does not include any files other than .ts files when transpiling the code. So, you need to tell the compiler to include the .env file.

Here's an example of how you can configure your tsconfig.json file to include the .env file:

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "module": "commonjs"
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.ts",
    ".env"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
The include property is an array of globs that match files to include. In this example, it includes all .ts files in the src directory, and the .env file.


# My impout 9:

added your suggestions. But the error is still: src/config.ts:9:20 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
  Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.

9     port: parseInt(process.env.DATABASE_PORT), 

# ChatGPT response 9:

It's possible that the issue may be caused because the dotenv.config() method is not being called before the variables are being accessed. Make sure that you are calling the dotenv.config() method before you are using the variables from the .env file like process.env.DATABASE_PORT.

Also make sure that you have the .env file at the root level of your project and that it is being loaded correctly by the dotenv package.

Another thing that could be causing the issue is that the .env file is not being included in the final build output, which means that it's not available when the application is running.

Make sure that the .env file is being included in the final build output by checking your build/bundling tool's configuration.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.


# My impout 10:

I do not understand how to check my build/bundling tool's configuration.

# ChatGPT response 10:

When you build your application, the TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript and the .env file is copied to the output directory.
It depends on the build tool you are using on how to check the configuration, but generally, you have to check the configuration of the tool that is responsible for building/bundling your application.

If you are using webpack for example, you can check the webpack.config.js file to see if the .env file is being included in the final build output.

If you are using a build tool like Parcel, the .env file should be automatically included in the final build output.

If you are not using a build tool, you can check the command you are using to run the build process and see if it includes the .env file.

If you don't have a build/bundling tool, you can check the command you are using to run the application and make sure that it includes the .env file.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

# ChatGPT response 11:

The problem is that you are not specifying the outdir property in the tsconfig.json file.
The outDir property specifies the directory where the transpiled JavaScript files should be written to.

You should add the following line to your tsconfig.json file:


"outDir": "./dist",
This will tell the TypeScript compiler to output the transpiled JavaScript files to the dist directory.

Also you should make sure that you include the .env file in the build process.
You can do that by adding it to the files or include property in the tsconfig.json file.

Here's an example of how you can configure your tsconfig.json file to include the .env file:


{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.ts",
    ".env"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ],
  "outDir": "./dist"
}
By doing this you are telling the compiler to include all .ts files in the src directory and the .env file in the compilation process and exclude all files in the node_modules directory and output the result to the dist folder.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.


# My impout 12:

The error is still there. But I changed the port: line in config.ts to port: process.env.DATABASE_PORT ? parseInt(process.env.DATABASE_PORT) : 5433,
and now I can do yarn build with no errors

# ChatGPT response 12:

That is great that you were able to solve the issue by using the ternary operator to handle the case when the DATABASE_PORT variable is undefined.

What you did is checking if the process.env.DATABASE_PORT is truthy(has a value), if it is true, it will parse it to int, if not it will use the default value of 5433.

That is a good way of handling undefined environment variables and it ensures that the application will always have a fallback value in case the environment variable is not defined.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

# My impout 13:

how do I run the program ?

# ChatGPT response 13:

You can run the program by using the command node dist/index.js in your terminal, this will execute the transpiled JavaScript code in the dist/index.js file.
Make sure you have set all the environment variables in your .env file before running the program.

You can also use a process manager like PM2 or Forever to run your application in the background and keep it running even after you close the terminal.

Another way to run your application is by using a package like npm-run-all, it allows you to run multiple npm scripts in parallel. You can use it to start both your backend and frontend applications in one command.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

# My impout 14:

Thanks. I was able to run the program. How do I set up vscode so that I can debug and step trough the code?

# ChatGPT response 14:

To set up debugging in Visual Studio Code for a Node.js application, you will need to install the "Debugger for Chrome" extension. This extension allows you to debug your JavaScript code using the Chrome DevTools.

Once the extension is installed, you can create a launch configuration that tells the extension how to run your application.

Here's an example launch configuration that you can use:


{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Debug Application",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/dist/index.js",
      "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env",
      "sourceMaps": true,
      "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"]
    }
  ]
}
This configuration tells the extension to launch your application by running the "dist/index.js" file, it also tells the extension to use the .env file in your workspace folder and tells the extension to use the source maps. The "outFiles" property tells the extension where to look for the transpiled files, in this case, it is looking for all .js files in the dist folder.

Once you have created the launch configuration, you can start debugging by clicking on the debug icon on


# My impout 15:

The "Debugger for Chrome" extension is Deprecated. I'm instructed to use the JavaScript Debugger instead. And this extension is already installed.

# ChatGPT response 15:

You are correct, the "Debugger for Chrome" extension has been deprecated in favor of the built-in JavaScript Debugger in Visual Studio Code.

To configure debugging in Visual Studio Code for a Node.js application, you will need to create a launch configuration that tells the extension how to run your application.

Here's an example launch configuration that you can use:

{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug Application",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/dist/index.js",
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env",
            "sourceMaps": true
        }
    ]
}
This configuration tells the extension to launch your application by running the "dist/index.js" file, it also tells the extension to use the .env file in your workspace folder and tells the extension to use the source maps.

Once you have created the launch configuration, you can start debugging by clicking on the debug icon in the sidebar, and then selecting the launch configuration you just created. This will start your application in debug mode and you can use the various debugging tools in VSCode to step through your code, set breakpoints, and inspect variables.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

# My impout 16:

I have added a console.log line and put a breakpopint on it. But the debugger does not stop at the line. This is the code from my index.ts: console.log("Starting")
main(); 

# ChatGPT response 16:

In order for the debugger to stop at a breakpoint, the code needs to be executed.
Are you running the code in debug mode? You can do this by clicking on the "Debug" button in the sidebar, or by pressing the F5 key on your keyboard.

When you run the code in debug mode, VSCode will automatically attach the debugger to the process and the breakpoints should be hit. If the breakpoint is not hit, this could be because the source code does not match the code that is being executed.

Make sure that you are running the correct file, and that the source code matches the code that is being executed. Also, check that the source maps are correctly configured in your launch configuration and that your program is using the correct source code file.

Additionally, you should make sure that the breakpoints are enabled, and that they are not being ignored by the debugger. You can check this by going to the "Breakpoints" view in the "Debug" sidebar, and make sure that the breakpoints you want to hit are not disabled.

If the issue persist, please let me know, I will be happy to help you further.

# My impout 17:

If i set the brakepoint in the dist/index.js file it works. But not when I set the breakpoint in src/index.ts It seems to me that there are some mapping missing. 

# ChatGPT response 17:

If the breakpoints are working when you set them in the generated JavaScript file (dist/index.js), but not when you set them in the TypeScript file (src/index.ts), it is likely that there is an issue with the source maps.

Source maps are used to map the generated JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code, so that the debugger can correctly show the original TypeScript code when you set breakpoints and step through the code.

There are a few things you can check to ensure that the source maps are correctly configured:

Check that the "sourceMap" option is set to "true" in your tsconfig.json file. This is necessary for TypeScript to generate source maps.

Check that the source maps are correctly linked to the JavaScript files. In the generated JavaScript file, there should be a comment at the end of the file that looks something like this:
//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map
Make sure that the source map file (index.js.map) exists in the same directory as the generated JavaScript file and that the file name is correctly referenced in this comment.

Check that the source maps are correctly loaded in the browser. In Chrome, you can go to the "Sources" tab in the developer tools, and check that the TypeScript files are correctly mapped to the generated JavaScript files.

Check that the "sourceMaps" option is set to "true" in your launch configuration in vscode.

If you have checked all of these and the issue persist, please let me know, I will be happy to help you further.

# My impout 18:

The "sourceMap" option in tsconfig.json was not set to "true". I added it and now it works

# ChatGPT response 18:

Great, I'm glad to hear that it's working now. The "sourceMap" option is essential for generating source maps, which allow the debugger to map the generated JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. Without this option, the debugger will not be able to correctly show the original TypeScript code when you set breakpoints and step through the code.

If you have any other questions or issues, feel free to ask.

# My impout 19:

Create a function named displayRecords that displays the following fields  organisasjonsnummer, navn, hjemmeside and antall_ansatte. Display the records in a table with the fields in the header.

# ChatGPT response 19:

Here is an example of a function named "displayRecords" that displays the specified fields in a table:


function displayRecords(records: any[]) {
    console.log("\nDisplaying records:");
    console.table(records.map(record => ({
        "Organisasjonsnummer": record.organisasjonsnummer,
        "Navn": record.navn,
        "Hjemmeside": record.hjemmeside,
        "Antall ansatte": record.antall_ansatte
    })));
}
This function takes an array of records as an argument, and then maps the array to a new array containing only the specified fields, "organisasjonsnummer", "navn", "hjemmeside" and "antall_ansatte". The resulting array is then displayed using the "console.table" method, which displays the array in a table with the fields in the header.

You can call this function after calling the "getFirstRecords" function, to display the returned records:


let records = await getFirstRecords();
displayRecords(records);
Please note that this example is made with the assumption that the fields you want to display are present in the records object, and that you are in a javascript environment.



# My impout 20:

The table brreg_enheter_alle is a table of organizations. The number of employees are defined by the field antall_ansatte. Create a new function named getLargestOrganizations that returns the records that has the most employees. Sort the results so that the organization with the largest amount of employees is at the top. There are many records in the table so it must be possible to pass a parameter named numberOfOrganizations to the function getLargestOrganizations that defines how many organizations to return. Use the already defined function displayRecords to display the result.

# ChatGPT response 20:

Here is an example of a function named "getLargestOrganizations" that returns the records with the most employees and sorts the results so that the organization with the largest amount of employees is at the top:


async function getLargestOrganizations(numberOfOrganizations: number) {
    let records = await getFirstRecords();
    records.sort((a, b) => b.antall_ansatte - a.antall_ansatte);
    let largestOrganizations = records.slice(0, numberOfOrganizations);
    displayRecords(largestOrganizations);
    return largestOrganizations;
}
This function first calls the already defined "getFirstRecords" function to get all the records, then it sorts the records by the field "antall_ansatte" in descending order using the sort() method. After that, it slices the array to only contain the specified number of organizations using the slice() method. Then it calls the displayRecords function to display the result, and then return the result.

You can call this function and pass the number of organizations you want to see like this:


let largestOrganizations = await getLargestOrganizations(5);
Please note that this is just an example and you may need to adjust the code to match your specific use case.

# My impout 22:

you cannot use the getFirstRecords function. You must create a new function that changes the select statement so that the database does the work of sorting and filtering the records.

# ChatGPT response 22:

Here's an example of a new function named "getLargestOrganizations" that retrieves the records with the most employees and sorts the results so that the organization with the largest amount of employees is at the top:


async function getLargestOrganizations(numberOfOrganizations: number) {
    let client = await connect();
    try {
        let results = await client.query(`SELECT organisasjonsnummer, navn, hjemmeside, antall_ansatte FROM brreg_enheter_alle ORDER BY antall_ansatte DESC LIMIT $1`, [numberOfOrganizations]);
        displayRecords(results.rows);
        return results.rows;
    } finally {
        client.release();
    }
}
This function first retrieves a client from the connection pool by calling the "connect" function. It then uses the client to execute a SQL query that selects the fields "organisasjonsnummer", "navn", "hjemmeside" and "antall_ansatte" from the "brreg_enheter_alle" table, orders the results by the "antall_ansatte" field in descending order and limits the result to the specified number of organizations. It then calls the "displayRecords" function to display the result, and then return the result.

You can call this function and pass the number of organizations you want to see like this:


let largestOrganizations = await getLargestOrganizations(5);
Please note that this is just an example and you may need to adjust the code to match your specific use case.

# My impout 23:

The connect() in the line  let client = await connect(); is not defined. Rewrite so that the getLargestOrganizations function uses the same way to connect as the getFirstRecords function
# ChatGPT response 23:

import { Pool } from 'pg';
import { config } from './config';

export async function getLargestOrganizations(numberOfOrganizations: number) {
    let client: Pool;

            user: config.user,
            host: config.host,
            database: config.database,
            password: config.password,
            port: config.port,
        });
        const res = await client.query(`SELECT organisasjonsnummer, navn, hjemmeside, antall_ansatte 
                                        FROM brreg_enheter_alle 
                                        ORDER BY antall_ansatte DESC 
                                        LIMIT ${numberOfOrganizations}`);
        displayRecords(res.rows);
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err.stack);
    } finally {
        client.end();
    }
}
You will also need to import the displayRecords function in the getLargestOrganizations file


import { displayRecords } from './displayRecords';
And make sure the displayRecords function accepts an array of records with the same fields as the query result.

---------------- out of context
Here I see that CatGPT has missed the context of the previous code.

ChatGPT assumes that displayRecords is in a separate file. 
The concept of a connection pool is also introduced. But this concept, no matter if it is a good idea, is not present in the first getFirstRecords function.
